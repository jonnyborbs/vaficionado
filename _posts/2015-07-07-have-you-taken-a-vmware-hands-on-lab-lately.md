The title really sort of says it all!

For those of you who don’t know, the VMware Hands-On Labs program is a truly unique offering in the industry, allowing customers anywhere to test drive any of VMware’s products in live environments. From anywhere, at any time. For free.

We provide you with the environment, the infrastructure, and all the software – pre-installed and configured. You just bring your imagination and willingness to learn. You don’t have to be a paying customer or be tied to a VMware software account of any kind. Just head on over to <https://labs.hol.vmware.com/> and register.

Once there, you can choose from the catalog of more than 50 labs (with 40 new or updated ones to be released at VMworld 2015) spanning our entire portfolio. Whether you’re interested in learning what’s new in vSphere 6, how to deploy advanced vRealize Automation integrations, get some stick time with an EVO:RAIL or see how to start moving your business to vCloud Air,the Hands-On Labs provides a safe and free place to do it.

But (shameless plug alert!) the best part about the Labs are the guidance, manuals and use cases that have been prepared to go along with them. Each lab is carefully designed by customer facing subject matter experts like yours truly, so that you can be sure the use cases are relevant and represent real world questions or situations that our customers ask about daily. Small teams of dedicated VMware employees each take great pride in investing hundreds of hours every year to make sure you have the most seamless, robust, amazing experience possible.

If you’d like to see an example of my work, **HOL-SDC-1421** (Using vRealize Automation to Build and Deploy Services and Applications) is a 101-level vRealize Automation lab my team wrote last year. It’s available in the public catalog now.

At VMworld this year, my dream team and I will be pleased to release **HOL-SDC-1632** (vRealize Automation Advanced: Integration and Extensibility) – our most advanced Automation lab ever. You won’t want to miss this one.

Big thanks go out to Burke Azbill ([@TechnicalValues](https://twitter.com/TechnicalValues)), Kim Delgado ([@KCDAutomate](https://twitter.com/KCDAutomate)), Shawn Kelly ([@shawnmkelly](https://twitter.com/shawnmkelly)), and Grant Orchard ([@grantorchard](https://twitter.com/grantorchard)) for making up 4/5 of the most collaborative, open-minded, hardest working HOL team in the whole company.

So head on over to the [portal](https://labs.hol.vmware.com/) and register, follow [@VMwareHOL](https://twitter.com/VMwareHOL) on Twitter, or better yet – join us at VMworld 2015 and take a few labs in person with our expert staff!

Did I mention that the Labs are **completely free**? I think I might have.
