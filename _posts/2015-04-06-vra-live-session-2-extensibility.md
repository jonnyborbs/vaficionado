Shameless plug here for an upcoming community event that @virtualjad over at [www.virtualjad.com](https://www.virtualjad.com) will be hosting later this month – vRA Live! – Session 2 – Extensibility

The vRA Live sessions are meant to provide a live and real-time demonstration of the power of vRealize Automation, combined with an expert panel (including yours truly) who will host open discussion and Q&amp;A while the magic happens. They are a lot of fun and incredibly informative.

Be sure to register in advance over at Jad’s blog (<https://www.virtualjad.com/2015/04/vra-live-session-2-extensibility.html>) – and we’ll see you there!
