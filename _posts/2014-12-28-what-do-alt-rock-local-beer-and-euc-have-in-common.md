Normally I wouldn’t have much insight on the subject of EUC (End-User Computin,), but my current trip home for the holidays has presented a pretty cool opportunity to highlight this amazing technology, even if it is outside my area of expertise.

We haven’t been home in few years, and it was my first chance to talk to some of the family in a while. We decided to go out one night to see my cousin Drew play with one of his bands, The Loveless. Here’s an action shot of Drew on bass.

This performance was paired with two amazing local beers – Loganberry Wit by [Resurgence](https://www.resurgencebrewing.com/), and [Live Pale Ale](https://www.stbcbeer.com/live-pale-ale-bottle-conditioned/) by Southern Tier. The Live Pale Ale is just a beautiful American style pale ale, with perfect hop character. But the Loganberry Wit was a real treat – those of us who grew up in the Buffalo area already know this, but for the uninformed, Loganberry is a berry widely used for punch-like drinks throughout Western New York and is a true regional flavor.

Anyway, by this point I’m sure you’re wondering what on earth all this has to do with VMware EUC. Well, as it turns out, Drew is part of a team of talented VMware administrators at Erie 1 BOCES (the Erie County Board of Cooperative Educational Services) who, in conjunction with the City of Buffalo, just implemented a tremendously successful VMware Horizon- based remote educational computing environment that has enabled Buffalo public school students to take their education with them to libraries and beyond.
