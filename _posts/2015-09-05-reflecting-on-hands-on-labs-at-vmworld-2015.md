Now that I’ve had a day or two to decompress after another action-packed VMworld, I thought it would be appropriate to just post a few thoughts about the experience.

I became involved with the Hands-On Labs shortly before VMworld 2014, making this my second cycle with the program. At the time, I had no idea how difficult or how rewarding the experience would be. As it turns out, participating in the Labs has been one of the single most personally and professionally satisfying undertakings of my life.

The development cycle began back in February of 2015, when a few of my fellow captains and I began developing what would be known as the “SDDC Base Pod” – a fully integrated single-site environment based on vSphere 6.0. This pod would contain all of the necessary components to showcase VMware’s Software-Defined Datacenter. Once extensive performance and integration testing had been completed, the pod was saved and made available to the rest of the individual lab development teams. This happened around May – and is when we really began creating our lab-specific content. All in all, each of us has contributed 500+ hours to the development, testing and delivery of this lab.

Working with Kim ([@KCDAutomate](https://twitter.com/KCDAutomate)), Shawn ([@ShawnMKelly](https://twitter.com/shawnmkelly)) and Grant ([@GrantOrchard](https://twitter.com/grantorchard)) with Burke ([@TechnicalValues](https://twitter.com/TechnicalValues)) as our leader, we laid down the additional software components, configuration, development and documentation to create the 8 amazing modules which comprised our 2015 lab. I’m pleased to be able to reveal the details of the lab now that VMworld has concluded:

HOL-SDC-1632 – vRealize Automation Advanced: Integration and Extensibility

A list of the modules is as follows:

- Module 1 – You Need More Integration
- Module 2 – An Introduction to Extensibility
- Module 3 – Integrating vRealize Automation with the VMware Cloud Management Platform
- Module 4 – Integrating vRealize Automation with Infoblox IPAM
- Module 5 – Integrating vRealize Automation with Puppet Enterprise
- Module 6 – Integrating vRealize Automation with NSX
- Module 7 – XaaS Services with Advanced Service Designer and vRealize Orchestrator
- Module 8 – Working with the vRealize Automation API

Each of the above were lovingly handcrafted by our team to show off not only the power and flexibility of the vRealize Automation engine, but also the amazing ways that it can be integrated into the other components of the VMware Cloud Management Platform as well as third party solutions that might already exist in your infrastructure.

But creating the labs are only the start. Delivering the content at both VMworld events and supporting it throughout the year is when the real work begins. The amazing Hands-On Lab staff works tirelessly to make sure that every attendee and lab user has a seamless, enlightening, engaging and enthralling experience. There are core staff, support staff, principals, captains, proctors and administrators. All of them play a role in making sure that the premier hands-on learning event in the industry can be a reality, and they all deserve huge thanks for their roles.

According to the surveys we received, our lab was a resounding success – as were the Expert-Led Workshops we hosted to teach our customers all about extensibility.

But, of course, events like this can’t be all work. We have plenty of fun too – and I’m very pleased to be able to call so many of these rockstars my friends, and want to thank some of them. Particularly:

- Jad, Chris and Tina for wrangling all the staff and dealing with all the administrative work that’s so important with this many staff
- Kim, Grant, Shawn and Burke for being the most amazing team I can think of. We’ve helped each other learn and grow so much in such a short time, and it’s been incredible
- Doug, Bill and Dave for supporting us as we built, tested, reimagined, rebuilt, re-tested and rebuilt the environments time and time again
- The rest of the principals, captains and proctors who helped create all the other content and made the lab room the bustling hive of expert conversation it was

That’s all for now – we’ll see some of you in a few weeks at VMworld in Barcelona – and keep an eye on the [Hands-On Labs portal](https://labs.hol.vmware.com/HOL/) for this year’s content to be available to you at home!

Now if you’ll excuse me, my grill is hot and these rib-eyes are calling my name. Paired with a 2011 Miner Oakville Cabernet, I don’t think I can wait much longer.
