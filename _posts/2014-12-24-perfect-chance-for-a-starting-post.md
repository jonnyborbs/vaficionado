Heading home for the holidays and managed a last-minute first class upgrade. What does that mean? A Bloody Mary and some VCAP study time, of course. Now, the aficionado in me says “thanks for the vodka and ketchup, United,” but the part of me that already drank half the cup is full of the holiday spirit and is willing to forgive the transgression.

Happy holidays and safe travels to all my colleagues, friends, followers, readers and customers.
