Greetings, readers! First of all, let me apologize for being absent for so long. I’ve been so incredibly busy with my new role as a product manager that I haven’t been able to blog nearly as much as I would have liked.

Also, a lot of the cool stuff I’ve been working on has been highly secretive until recently – but now that our new flagship VMware Cloud Automation Services have been released, I’m free to start talking more about it publicly!

If you’re not already aware of it, VMware Cloud Automation Services (sometimes called CAS for short) is a SaaS-based Cloud Management platform, built from the ground up to enable multi-cloud consumption and pave over all those potholes you might hit as you drive the “Hybrid Highway.” If you’re interested, we are offering free 30-day trials at <https://cloud.vmware.com/cloud-assembly> – and I hope you check it out!

One of the cool things I’ve been working on as a side project has been a collection of APIs that show not only the power and potential of this platform, but how rapidly you can go from swiping your credit card to fully automated, multi-cloud provisioning and management.

It’s really gratifying to be able to show how you can go from a blank, brand new Cloud Automation Services organization to one that is fully configured, connected to multiple clouds, contains a cloud-agnostic blueprint and has even provisioned and managed some resources – all in **under 90 seconds**.

To that end, I’ve published the API collection at <https://github.com/vaficionado/cas-apis> for the interested to review, use, update and contribute to. Your comments and contributions are welcome! I’ll keep the description of the collection short and sweet here, since [@CodyDeArkland](https://twitter.com/codydearkland) and I will be maintaining and managing the collection directly on GitHub – but right now, it’s everything you need to go from zero to multi-cloud hero!

Check it out, and please leave any feedback either here or on GitHub.

This message has been brought to you by a delicious Single Malt Miyagikyo I recently had the opportunity to sample at the home of another outstanding community member, none other than the one and only [Virtual Hobbit](https://virtualhobbit.com/) – smooth and easy drinking, and a most gentlemanly thing to have on hand for me as he doesn’t like whisky himself.

Cheers!
