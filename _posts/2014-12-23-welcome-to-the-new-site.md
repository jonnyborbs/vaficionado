A new year is beginning and with it, a new idea for a blog. Hopefully I’ll actually come up with some content for this one.

The overall idea here is to combine the two things I enjoy most – virtualization and alcohol. Now, let’s not start this whole thing out on the wrong foot – I’m not floating around in a kiddie pool on my front lawn, surrounded by Bud Light cans and ESXi discs. Not in December, anyway. We’re going to take a slightly more refined approach to this whole thing.

I hope to assemble some useful info surrounding my specific area of expertise – which is VMware Cloud Management – and combine each post with some info about a particular wine, beer, vineyard, or concept. Maybe I’ll even throw some cheese in there, who knows.

For the moment, this is just the beginning phases of the plan. Stay tuned for more info!
